    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <div>
        <p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case
            of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind
            of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>
        <p>Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a
            set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs
            have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[1]
            The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in
            response to different inputs or conditions.</p>
        <p>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many
            programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while
            other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</p>
    </div>
    <p>Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation,
        analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.</p>
    <p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or
        algorithm.[2] Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all
        possible algorithms.</p>
    <i>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics
        (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language.Some languages are defined by a specification document
        (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl)
        have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language
        defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</i>
